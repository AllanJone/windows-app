# ListenMoeClient
A listen.moe client for Windows

**It's terrible, use at own peril**

# Instructions
Open it. It plays music. 
The form will snap to any screen edges, and you can mouse scroll on the form to increase/decrease the volume.

# Todo

 - Code cleanup
 - Anime reverse lookup (waiting on Kana to give me this data)
 - Exception and error handling on the audio streaming
 - Hide from alt-tab, always on top options
 - Taskbar media player controls, global media hotkey hooks
 - Scrolling title/artist for ones that are too long
