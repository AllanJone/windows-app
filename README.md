A listen.moe client for Windows.

**It's terrible, use at own peril**

# Instructions
Open it. It plays music. 
The form will snap to any screen edges, and you can mouse scroll on the window to increase/decrease the volume. You can also set it to be topmost by right clicking the window and selecting 'Always on top'. 

Sometimes, the audio stream may seem to be the wrong pitch. Just pause the stream and play it again, and it should fix itself.

# Todo

 - Code cleanup
 - Anime reverse lookup (waiting on Kana to give me this data)
 - Exception and error handling on the audio streaming
 - Hide from alt-tab
 - Taskbar media player controls, global media hotkey hooks
